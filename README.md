# Modelling the Spread of Health Misinformation and Trust-Based Belief Updating in Gendered Digital Environments

This repository encapsulates modelling on the evolution of group beliefs over time, focusing on the impact of interventions such as "Correction Boosts." Utilising agent-based modelling and network science, the project simulates belief propagation within social networks, offering insights into how interventions can influence collective belief systems.

## Research Objectives
* Modelling Belief Dynamics: Develop agent-based models to simulate belief formation and evolution within groups.
* Intervention Analysis: Assess the effectiveness of various interventions, including misinformation correction strategies, on altering group beliefs.
* Visualisation: Create dynamic visualisations to illustrate belief changes and intervention impacts over time.

## Methodology
* Agent-Based Modelling: Implemented using Python and NetworkX to simulate interactions and belief updates among agents within a network.
* Intervention Strategies: Introduced "Correction Boosts" at specific time steps to evaluate their influence on belief trajectories.
* Data Visualisation: Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate heatmaps and line plots, visualising belief distributions and the effects of interventions.

## Key Features
* Heatmaps: Display temporal belief distributions across agents, highlighting the spread and concentration of beliefs.
* Line Plots: Illustrate average belief trends for different groups, with annotations marking intervention points.

## Impact and Findings
* Intervention Efficacy: Demonstrated that timely interventions can significantly alter group belief trajectories.
* Visualisation Insights: Provided clear visual representations of belief dynamics, aiding in the understanding of complex social processes.

## Technologies Used
* Programming Languages: Python
* Libraries: NetworkX, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy
